/*
Use the time structure from Exercise 9, and write a program that obtains two time values from the user in 12:59:59 format, stores them in struct time variables, converts each one to seconds (type int ), adds these quantities, converts the result back to hours-minutes-seconds, stores the result in a time structure, and finally displays the result in 12:59:59 format.
